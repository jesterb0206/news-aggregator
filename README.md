The QTRO: A Comprehensive News Aggregator

## Description

We created a website that collects current news articles from multiple sources, as well as provides real-time NFL scores and displays interesting number facts, displaying them all in one place in an easy-to-use format. The QTRO will also save all of your favorite number facts in a simple, intuitive format. 

This project was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, API data, Jquery, and Tailwind. The project demonstrates the ability to use multiple different APIs together to create a website, with multiple user interactive elements. Additionally, the project display responsiveness, with different uses of traditional CSS and also Tailwind CSS. 

The project was designed to display a 'cleaner' user interface while browsing newspaper articles, display articles from multiple sources to help the user from browsing multiple sources for a catagory or search term, and to view NFL live scores while nagivating news articles.
